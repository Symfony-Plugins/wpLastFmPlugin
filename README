# wpLastFm Plugin #

The `wpLastFmPlugin` is a Symfony plugin that retrieves information from last.fm using their API.

It comes with default templates for quick and easy display of standard last.fm methods (getRecentTracks and getTopArtists) but can also be used to access any other method from the 
[last.fm API](http://www.last.fm/api "last.fm"). Before you can use this plugin you need to apply for an API key on the [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/api/account "last.fm") website.

# Installation #

  * Install the plugin

        $ ./symfony plugin:install wpLastFmPlugin

  * Activate the plugin in the `config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php`
  
        [php]
        class ProjectConfiguration extends sfProjectConfiguration
        {
          public function setup()
          {
            $this->enablePlugins(array(
              'wpLastFmPlugin',
              '...'
            ));
          }
        }

  * Next you have to change both the API key that you received from last.fm and your last.fm username in the `app.yml` of the plugin:

        [yml]
        # plugins/wpLastFmPlugin/config/app.yml
        all:
          wp_lastfm:
            web_dir:   /wpLastFmPlugin
            api_key:   xxxxxx
            username:  xxxxxx

  * If you want to use one of the default templates you have to enable the lastFm module in your `settings.yml`

        [php]
          all:
          enabled_modules:        [default, ..., wpLastFm]

  * Clear you cache

        $ ./symfony cc


# Using a default template #

In the template of the page where you want to display your top played artists just do the following:

    [php]
    include_component('wpLastFm', 'topArtists');

You can also show your last played tracks by including the following component:

    [php]
    include_component('wpLastFm', 'recentTracks');

## Modify the displayed results ##

You can pass parameters to both components to modify the displayed results.

The topArtists component accepts the following parameters:

  * `count`: number of results you want to show
  * `rows`: number of vertical rows you want to use to display your results
  * `image_size`: size of the artist thumbnail (value can be SMALL, MEDIUM or LARGE)

        [php]
        include_component('wpLastFm', 'topArtists', array('count' => 18, 'rows' => 3, 'image_size' => 'SMALL'));

The topArtists component accepts the following parameters:

  * `count`: number of results you want to show
  * `image_size`: size of the artist thumbnail (value can be SMALL, MEDIUM or LARGE)

        [php]
        include_component('wpLastFm', 'recentTracks', array('count' => 3, 'image_size' => 'MEDIUM'));

If you are not happy about the used colors just override the css classes in the main css of your application.

# Retrieve and display data manually #

To get your data from last.fm just look up the name of the method in the [last.fm API](http://www.last.fm/api "last.fm") and pass it to the get method (in this example we get the top tracks of a user):

    [php]
    // Retrieve the top tracks for the user that we have set in the app.yml
    $lastfm = new wpLastFm();
    $result = $lastfm->get('user.getTopTracks');

    // Retrieve the top tracks of a different last.fm user
    $lastfm = new wpLastFm('kielabokkie');
    $result = $lastfm->get('user.getTopTracks');

This will return a SimpleXML object containing the result of your query. So to get the information of the tracks in this example we would do the following:

    [php]
    // Retrieve the top tracks for the user that we have set in the app.yml
    $lastfm = new wpLastFm();
    $result = $lastfm->get('user.getTopTracks');
    $tracks = $result->toptracks->track;

    // Iterate through the $tracks object to get the individual results
    foreach($tracks AS $track) {
      // Do something with the track attributes here
      echo 'name: ' . $track->name . '<br/>';
    }

Some methods in the last.fm API also accept additional parameters. We can make use of these parameters by passing them to the get method in an array:

    [php]
    // Retrieve the top tracks of the last seven days
    $lastfm = new wpLastFm();
    $result = $lastfm->get('user.getTopTracks', array('period' => '7day'));
